# phd-thesis
This repository contains my Ph.D. thesis paper "[Tackling Graphical NLP problems with Graph Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06142)" and my defense [slides](./thesis_talk.pdf).
The thesis covers my recent work in applying graph recurrent network (GRN) on the four following graphical NLP problems:

* Multi-hop reading comprehension (Chapter 3, will be published at TKDE 2020) [link-to-repo](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/MHQA)
* _N_-ary relation extraction (Chapter 4, published at EMNLP 2018) [link-to-repo](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/nary-grn)
* AMR-to-text generation (Chapter 5, published at ACL 2018) [link-to-repo](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/neural-graph-to-seq-mp)
* Semantic neural machine translation (Chapter 6, published at TACL2019) [link-to-repo](https://github.com/freesunshine0316/semantic-nmt)

Hope this can be helpful to you. Please create issues for questions and dicussions. 
I won't check my University email accounts as offen as I did previously.
